            "AI needs data to learn, just as a human needs experiences to learn. This data can be text, images, numbers, or recordings. \n",

            "### 2. The Engine: Algorithms and Models\n",

            "### 3. The Process: Training\n",

            "2.  **Guess:** It says, \"I am 60% sure this is a dog.\"\n",
            "3.  **Correction:** The system is told, \"No, that was a cat.\"\n",

            "Once the model is trained, it enters the \"inference\" phase. This is when the AI is put into the real world to handle data it has never seen before.\n",
            "*   **Example:** You upload a new photo to Google Photos, and the AI correctly labels it \"Beach Trip\" because it recognizes the patterns of sand and water it learned during training.\n",

            "*   **Garbage In, Garbage Out:** If you train an AI on bad, biased, or incorrect data, the AI will produce bad, biased, or incorrect results.\n",
            "*   **Narrow vs. General AI:** \n",

            "Here are some key details about it:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Construction and Parts\n",
            "*   **Body (Tumba):** The large bulbous body at the bottom is usually made from a dried, hollowed-out pumpkin gourd. The top part (face) is made of wood.\n",
            "*   **Neck (Dand):** A long, hollow neck made of teak or tun wood. \n",
            "*   **Upper Resonator:** Many sitars, like the one in the photo, have a second, smaller gourd at the top of the neck to help balance the instrument and enhance its resonance.\n",
            "*   **Frets:** It features curved metal frets that are movable. Because they are raised and curved, players can pull the strings sideways to create the characteristic \"gliding\" notes known as *meend*.\n",
            "*   **Strings:** A sitar typically has 18 to 21 strings. \n",
            "    *   **Main strings:** 6 or 7 strings are played directly.\n",
            "    *   **Sympathetic strings (Tarab):** Located underneath the main strings, these are not plucked. Instead, they vibrate in resonance with the notes being played, giving the sitar its signature shimmering, lingering sound.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. How it's Played\n",
            "*   The musician sits on the floor, holding the instrument at an angle across their lap.\n",
            "*   The strings are plucked using a wire plectrum called a **mizrab**, worn on the index finger of the right hand.\n",
            "*   The left hand is used to press the strings against the frets and pull them to change the pitch.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Its Sound\n",
            "The sitar has a very distinctive, rich, and metallic sound with complex harmonics. The combination of the hollow body and the sympathetic strings creates a \"buzzing\" or \"twanging\" quality that is instantly recognizable.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Cultural Significance\n",
            "*   **Origins:** It evolved into its current form in the 18th century in India.\n",
            "*   **Global Popularity:** While deeply rooted in ancient Indian musical traditions, the sitar became world-famous in the 1960s. This was largely due to the legendary **Ravi Shankar**, who taught **George Harrison** of The Beatles how to play, leading to its use in Western rock and pop music.\n",
            "*   **Famous Players:** Other renowned masters include Vilayat Khan, Nikhil Banerjee, and more recently, Anoushka Shankar.\n"
